# LSS Ã— TALK Ã— Whitebox

*A White Paper on Language-Centric AI Control and Protocol-Based Interaction Design*

This project presents a declarative system architecture for deterministic interaction with large language models (LLMs). It introduces:

- **LSS (Language System Shell)** â€“ A persistent protocol wrapper for contextual control  
- **TALK (True AI Language Kernel)** â€“ A semantic command layer for unambiguous instruction  
- **Whitebox Usage Model** â€“ A structured paradigm to replace prompt-based guessing
