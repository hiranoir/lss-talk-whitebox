# LSS × TALK × Whitebox Control

🧭 A Language-Driven Control Framework for AI Behavior  
Version: 1.0 | Author: HiraNoir | Date: June 22, 2025

## 📖 Overview

This whitepaper outlines a declarative system for controlling AI behavior through structured language protocols — not prompts. It introduces:

- **LSS (Language System Shell)** — a persistent behavior shell
- **TALK (True AI Language Kernel)** — a protocol language for AI instructions
- **Whitebox Usage** — a repeatable, testable interaction model

Together, these components form a programmable interface for human-AI collaboration based on semantic integrity and behavioral containment.

## 🧱 Core Concepts

- Prompt ≠ Control  
- Language ≠ Message  
- Memory = Contaminant Vector  
- Drift is not style — it’s corrosion.

## 🧩 Why This Exists

Most AI usage today is reactive, fragile, and based on expressive guessing. This system is built on a belief:

> **“Language is the machine. Structure is control.”**

You don’t prompt.  
You declare, bind, and contain.
